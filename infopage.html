        <p id=text><b>Wildfires are one of the most enviromentally damaging natural disasters with an average of 1.2 million acres of US woodland burning every year. Nearly 3 billion animals were killed or displaced in the 2020 Austrailian bush fires alone. In 2018 more than 58,083 wildfires burned over 8.7 million acres causing around $24 billion in damage. Larger wildfires are even capable of modifying the local weather conditions, and we as humans are part of the problem as manmade combustions from arson, human carelessness, or lack of fire safety cause wildfire disasters every year.</b> </p>

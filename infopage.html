        <p id=text><b>Wildfires around the world occur  An average of 1.2 million acres of US woodland burn every year, and just in 2018 alone, more than 58,083 wildfires burned more than 8.7 million acres and generated around $24 billion in damage. Larger wildfires are even capable of modifying the local weather conditions, and we as humans are mainly to blame for this as manmade combustions from arson, human carelessness, or lack of fire safety cause wildfire disasters every year.</b> </p>
